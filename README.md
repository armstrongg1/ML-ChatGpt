# Machine Learning Project with ChatGPT

This Python-based project leverages the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the OpenAI platform to enhance product data extraction and processing.

## Overview

The central premise of this project is to extract product data from an API and process it using machine learning techniques. After this initial processing, the data is passed to the ChatGPT language model to fill in any missing information. 

Using the sophisticated AI capabilities of OpenAI, our project can fill gaps and provide a more complete and accurate description of the products. This approach can be particularly useful when the product data are incomplete or inconsistent. 

## Features

- **Product Data Extraction**: The project can robustly and automatically extract product data from an API.
- **Data Processing**: We employ machine learning techniques to process and analyze the extracted data.
- **Data Completion with ChatGPT**: Using OpenAI's ChatGPT, the project can fill in missing product information, providing a more comprehensive and accurate view.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary language used for the project.
- **OpenAI Chat API**: The AI platform used for filling in missing data.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Regular Expressions (re module)**: Used for searching and manipulating strings.
- **Concurrent Futures**: Used for creating parallel tasks, thus speeding up processing.
- **Numpy**: Used for numerical computations.
- **NLP (Natural Language Processing)**: Used for the processing of data.
